# Image-Classification-and-Job-Mapping-using-ResNet50
This project uses the pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify images and map predictions to corresponding job professions. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, it processes user-provided images, predicts their content, and associates them with relevant occupations, demonstrating the use of AI in image processing.
