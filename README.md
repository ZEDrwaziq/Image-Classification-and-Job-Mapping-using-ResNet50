# Image Processing and Classification Project

## Project Description

This project uses the **ResNet50 deep learning model**, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to classify images and map their predicted classes to potential job professions. The pipeline demonstrates the use of **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for image preprocessing, classification, and mapping output to human-readable labels.

**Supervisor:** Dr. Asad Alsharefi
